## 🚀 Overview

**Ramadan Recipe Planner AI** is a state-of-the-art web application designed to revolutionize how families plan their meals during Ramadan. Developed by **Ammar Khan**, a TY B.E. Information Technology student, this platform combines the power of **Generative AI** with intuitive design to solve the daily dilemma of *"What should we cook for Suhoor and Iftar?"*.

Unlike static recipe sites, this app understands your context—family size, budget, cuisine preferences, and location—to generate **hyper-personalized**, day-by-day meal plans complete with shopping lists and preparation guides.
